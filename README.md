## Overview
This is a simple web application that tests a user's secret. The secret is hard-coded as 'validsecret'. If they enter this secret, the app displays a message saying the secret is valid. If they enter any other text, the app displays a message saying the secret is invalid.

## Setup
To set up this app, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. There are no additional dependencies or setup steps.

## Usage
To use the app, type your secret into the text box and click the "Test" button. The app will then display a message below the button indicating whether or not the secret is valid.
